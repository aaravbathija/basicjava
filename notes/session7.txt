Synatx is very important 
if comfortable with synatx, you can find errors and other things easily
if statement is always followed by parenthesis for code
Condition will tell whether it is true or false based on what x and y are
else if statements are used when there is another outcome instead of the if statement 
use as many as needed 
for loops has three parts to it
Those are what x=, what x is less than or greater to, and what to add to x
it is like that so you can print as many lines as you want( if the code is correct and based on the statements)
When classifying a person, use String or integer
When using integer, you can only use numbers
When using words, you can only use words but when printing it, you have to have the words you want in quotation marks
Use example, action, input, output
