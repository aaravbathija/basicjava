Computer = Hardware + Software

First Part

Hardware = Things you can touch or feel
	- Mouse, keyboard, CPU
CPU
C - Central
P - Processing
U - Unit
CPU is like a brain

RAM
- Where things can be done temperarly 
- Like a pen and scratch pad

Hard Disk
- Saves things permanently

Second Part 

Software = Things you cannot touch or feel
	- Operating System
	   - Software we interact with to run other programs
		- Windows 10, Windows 7, Xp, OS X, Linux
Program - A set of instructions

Decimal System 

546 = (5*100)+(4*10)+(6*1) 
		Or
      (5*10^2)+(4*10^1)+(6*10^0)
- Uses numbers 0-9
- Uses 10 numbers and base called 10
- Deca is 10 and hence it is called decimal

Binary System

- Uses only numbers 0-1
- To convert from decimal to binary, you use powers of 2
 
For example: 83
It uses the numbers 64+16+2+1
There is no number in the place for the 32, 8, and 4
So, the binary number for 83 is 1010011

We learned binary because computers use the binary system
